// ok new plan, carousel will look basic and shitty.  i want to have small thumbnails and when ok i clicked it will present a larger image with descriptive text overlayed. except i want it to populate and depopulate on subsequent clicks with an animejs disintegration effect. 

const Projects = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>still workin' on it</h1>
            <ProjectAnime />
        </div>
    )

export default Projects;
